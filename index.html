Welcome to my site! I'm Kyle Burnette. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I recently immigrated to Canada from Florida. I am
also a former full-time YouTube video content creator and streamer on Twitch.tv. Here, you can learn more about 
me and my projects. I also aim to write articles about a variety of subjects, including programming, life, and 
other things that seem interesting!


If you're looking for my most impressive project right off the bat, it's definitely <a href="https://kyleburnette.com/portfolio/1.%20projectoceanside/">Project Oceanside</a>.
This is a great example of a community having a problem and me working to solve it. I couldn't be more proud. Check it out for more info!
