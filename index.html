Welcome to my site! I'm Kyle Burnette. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I recently immigrated to Canada. I am
also a former full-time YouTube video content creator and streamer on Twitch.tv. Here, you can learn more about 
me and my projects. I also aim to write articles about a variety of subjects, including programming, life, and 
other things that seem interesting!
