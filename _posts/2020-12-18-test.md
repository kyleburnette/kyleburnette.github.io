Welcome! I hope you're doing well.

On this site, I want to keep track of all of my projects so people can find them more easily. I'd also like to occasionally write blog posts about topics of all sorts, though mostly about programming.

If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to email me at the email in the sidebar on the left.
