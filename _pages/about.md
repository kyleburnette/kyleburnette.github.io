Hi there, I’m Kyle Burnette. Here’s a bit about me.

I am originally from Jacksonville, Florida. Quite a different place from Vancouver, BC! 

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of Florida in 2016, and my original plan was to become a research scientist, but fate had something else in mind. Just before graduation, I performed at a charity event called [Awesome Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/). While I was there, I met a girl from Vancouver, and, long story short, I live here now.

Fortunately for me, I am a full-time YouTube video content creator and Twitch.tv partnered streamer. If it weren't
for this, I would certainly not have been able to immigrate to Canada as quickly as I did. I am extremely thankful
for all of the people that have made this possible!

In the spare time I had while waiting for my permanent residency, I decided I wanted to learn a new skill, and thus began my journey into programming. I picked up a book called Automate the Boring Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart. I devoured it in a weekend, and I’ve coded pretty much daily since then. I have several projects that you can check out on my Portfolio page.

But yeah, that’s me! Other than that, I enjoy cooking, video games, football, coffee, and hanging out with my dog. I’ve also recently gotten into chess.
