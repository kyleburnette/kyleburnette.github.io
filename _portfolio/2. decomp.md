## Overview

**Programming Languages:** C, MIPS  
**Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

The Zelda games on the Nintendo 64 were originally programmed in C. The N64 runs a MIPS instruction set, meaning the goal of the decompilation project is to decompile the game from MIPS back to readable C. The end goal of the decompilation is a completely matching decompilation.

To do this, there are many tools involved. The project pages go into those tools in great detail if you wish to learn more.

## Motivation

Preserving games is an important topic for many gamers. But it's not only that - learning how they work is extremely rewarding. Decompiling the Zelda games and being able to read precisely what the developers at Nintendo wrote in Japan in the 90s is like a gateway into the past. Decompiling the games is important for preservation, understanding, and it also has applications in speedrunning and ROM hack development.

## Strengths and Improvements

These projects are still somewhat new, so I'll do a postmortem later on in their lifecycles.
